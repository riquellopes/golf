==============

This projects it was wrote in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) there many year ago, It was my first [crawler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) written in [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/), and now I rewritten the main features in [golang](https://golang.org/). In the first realease of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) app, I used [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) + [mlab](https://mlab.com/) to persist the informations, but now I'm just scraping the information of web site and sending to api.
